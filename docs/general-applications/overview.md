General applications are applications that everyone can use these features regardless of the role. Currently, common applications have several features, namely: 
1. Version Control
2. Issue Center
3. Contact User Lists
4. Notepad
5. Quote Reports
6. Track Delivery

So we will tell you a more like overview or introduction about each application here.

## Issue Center
This feature is for connecting between each employee, between employee and developers, so if an employee found a bug on the system, he/she can report this issue/bug on this feature, he/she no need to contact the developers/other employees on his/her private phone. This feature is simple to use because it is just as simple like you write your title's problem, the explanation of your problem, and submit, and your issue will send to the email's assigned user. Of course, the assignee's user will receive your issue, and you will get the status of your issue. This feature is authorized for all users, so it has a system from you to you, and by you.

## User Contact Lists
User contact lists are just for if users wanna see the other user who registered on this system, and maybe he/she wanna check his/her Instagram or his/her Facebook to connect, of course, they can do it.

## Notepad
Yes, sure we add this feature to my system because we think many people sometimes forget his note, "where did I put that note?". So for not urgent needs, we add this feature as a reminder page for users.
So of course we add some labels which are Favorite, Personal, Work, Social, and Important. Also, users can edit the notes and see when users create the notes.

## Quote Report
Quote report is the feature that just publishes the quote words, yeah you know for increasing the employee's motivation. We thought that this feature is not useful. We add this feature because there are a few of company need this feature.

## Track Delivery
Yaps the first thought we made this is, "how if we provide the tools that can track our order's on any e-commerce platform, or maybe when we send the goods to our customers, we can track our delivery at real-time", so we mean to make it happens, we make the tools, connecting it to expedition's open API, and provide the data here. So currently we can provide you to can track your delivery on:
- JET Express
- TIKI
- JNE
- SiCepat
